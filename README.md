# Task_06_Deep_Fake

An ethical, documented workflow that turns **Task 05** stats into a short **AI‑generated interview**.
This repo contains both **Audio-only** and **Video** (talking-head / lip‑sync) paths.

> **Disclosure**: All outputs here are clearly labeled as AI-generated. Real-person likeness/voice requires consent.

## What’s included
- A filled **narrative** from Task 05 stats.
- A **10‑Q&A interview script** (Reporter: *Kunal Ahirrao*; Coach: *Regy Thorpe*).
- Ready **audio files** (combined interview) and placeholders for separate tracks.
- Step‑by‑step **audio** and **video** workflows with `ffmpeg` commands.
- **Ethics** statement + **consent** template.
- A **process log** written by Kunal that documents approach and learning.

## Quick start
- Play the full interview: `audio/interview_mix.mp3`
- If you have separate lines, replace the placeholders:
  - `audio/disclosure.wav`
  - `audio/reporter.wav`
  - `audio/coach.wav`
  Then run the commands in `scripts/01_workflow_audio_only.md` to re‑mix.

## Submission
- Push this folder to a public GitHub repo named **Task_06_Deep_Fake**.

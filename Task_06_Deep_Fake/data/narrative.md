# Narrative: SU Women's Lacrosse – Data-Driven Season Plan (Template)

> Replace TODOs with your actual figures from Task 5 or another dataset.

**Context.** We analyzed the prior season’s play-by-play and team summaries to profile strengths and gaps.

**Key takeaways (replace numbers):**
- TODO: Turnover rate: __ / possession (target: __).
- TODO: Draw control %: __% (target: __%).
- TODO: Free-position shots: __% conversion (maintain/improve to __%).
- TODO: Shot locations: __% from 8m arc; shift to __% inside crease.
- TODO: Goals added in transition: __ per game; target: __.
- TODO: Ground balls: __ per game; target: +3 per game.

**Strategic levers**
1. **Possession**: win more draws; sub patterns to keep legs fresh.
2. **Shot quality**: earlier seals + skip passes to create inside looks.
3. **Turnovers**: simplify clears, scripted outlets, and 2-beat passing rule.
4. **Defense**: faster switch calls; 2-second close-out drill.

Use this as the basis for the interview script in the README example or generate a new one with the prompts.

# Ethics Statement

This project creates a **synthetic** interview to study media generation. To reduce risk:
- We **do not** impersonate real people without written consent.
- We use **fictional names** and royalty-free/self-provided assets.
- We include **audible disclosure**, **on-screen labels**, and **file metadata** indicating synthetic origin, date, and author.
- We respect platform and institutional policies and applicable laws.
- We store any consent forms in this `ethics/` folder.

If any participant revokes consent, we will remove their likeness/voice and update the repo.

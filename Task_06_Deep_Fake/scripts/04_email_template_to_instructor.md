Hello Dr. Strome,

I’m submitting my Research Task 06: Deep Fake. The public repo is here:
<PASTE YOUR GITHUB LINK>

Notes:
- I followed an ethical, transparency-first workflow (see `ethics/`).
- I documented my process in `scripts/05_process_log_template.md`.
- Output is in the `audio/` (and `video/` if applicable) folder.

Please let me know if you'd like additional materials.

Best,
<Your Name>

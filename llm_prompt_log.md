# Prompt Log (Task 06 — SU Women’s Lacrosse Interview)

---

## Attempt 1
**Goal:** Draft a 2-minute sideline interview (Reporter + Coach) using Task 05 insights.  
**Prompt:**  
*"Write a 10-Q&A interview between Reporter Kunal Ahirrao and Coach Regy Thorpe.  
Keep answers grounded in Task 05 stats (wins/losses, average goals, shots on goal, saves).  
Style: conversational, 1–3 sentences per response, with a disclosure at the start."*  

**Model:** ChatGPT (GPT-5)  
**Output Summary:** Produced a detailed 10-Q&A dialogue. Clear use of stats (avg goals, SOG, saves). Tone felt natural and fit a sideline interview.  
**Self-Evaluation:** Good first draft; a couple of answers too long for TTS pacing.  
**Next Change:** Shorten sentences slightly, aim for tighter rhythm in audio.

## Attempt 2
**Goal:** Improve pacing for TTS voices.  
**Prompt:**  
*"Revise the 10-Q&A lacrosse interview. Limit each answer to 1–2 sentences (10–14 words each). Maintain natural speech flow. Keep disclosure line intact."*  

**Model:** ChatGPT (GPT-5)  
**Output Summary:** Produced shorter, snappier answers. Easier to read for synthetic voices. Stats preserved, less jargon.  
**Self-Evaluation:** Much better for audio clarity. Still needs slight variation in reporter phrasing.  
**Next Change:** Add more variety to question openers (e.g., “How would you describe…”, “Looking back…”) to avoid repetition.

# Video workflow (Talking head / Lip‑sync)

## Option A — SadTalker (still image → talking head)
1. Place a consented portrait in `assets/portrait.jpg`.
2. Use your audio (reporter/coach or the mixed MP3) to drive the animation.
3. Add an on‑screen label in the first 3 seconds: “AI‑Generated Interview — Research”.

## Option B — Wav2Lip (lip‑sync a silent video)
1. Record a short silent interview shot (you/consenting friend) nodding at camera.
2. Use Wav2Lip to sync the `audio/interview_mix.mp3` to the video.
3. Export to `video/interview_synced.mp4`.

[Coach: Regy Thorpe]
(A1) It was a year of close contests - we averaged 12.37 for and 11.63 against, so a few plays often decided results.
(A2) Volume was there - 538 shots and 403 on frame ( approximately 74.91 percent SOG). We'll create more inside looks to lift conversion.
(A3) We controlled tempo and finished chances; that game showed our ceiling when possessions are clean.
(A4) Managing runs - sharper defensive communication and better spacing in clears to kill momentum.
(A5) Two levers: cut unforced turnovers and win about  plus 3 ground balls per game for extra shots.
(A6) They're possession multipliers; more wins there reduce defensive pressure and build offensive rhythm.
(A7) Earlier switch calls so keepers see shots longer; force outside looks to raise save rates.
(A8) Rotate middies for fresh legs on draws and add an initiator behind the goal to diversify lanes.
(A9) Fewer unforced turnovers,  plus 3 ground balls per game, and >50 percent draw controls.
(A10) We're trending up - tighter details, better possessions, and ready to finish close games.

**Reporter (Kunal):** Coach Thorpe, thanks for joining us. Looking back at 19 games and a 10-9 record, how would you summarize the season?
**Coach (Regy):** It was a year of close contests — we averaged 12.37 goals for and 11.63 against, so most nights one or two plays decided the outcome.

**Reporter:** Your attack averaged over 12.37 goals. What fueled the scoring, and where can shot quality improve?
**Coach:** We created volume — 538 total shots with 403 on frame (~74.91% SOG). The next step is more inside looks and quicker skip passes to lift our conversion rate.

**Reporter:** What did you learn from the biggest win against California (18-6)?
**Coach:** We controlled tempo early and finished chances. That game showed our ceiling when possessions are clean and we win the physical battles.

**Reporter:** And the toughest loss to #2 BOSTON COLLEGE (2-17) — what’s the correction there?
**Coach:** Managing runs. We need faster defensive communication and to kill momentum with smarter clears and better spacing.

**Reporter:** The average margin was about +0.74 goals. How do you flip those one‑possession games?
**Coach:** Two levers: cut unforced turnovers and get +3 ground balls per game. Both translate directly into extra shots.

**Reporter:** How do draw controls and ground balls fit into that plan?
**Coach:** They’re possession multipliers. A few more wins there reduce pressure on our defense and give our offense rhythm.

**Reporter:** With 162 total saves and 403 shots on goal, what’s the focus for the goalie unit?
**Coach:** Better shot visibility and forcing outside looks. If we communicate early on switches, our keepers see the ball longer and save rates climb.

**Reporter:** Any lineup tweaks to support these goals?
**Coach:** We’ll rotate middies to keep legs fresh on draws and add an initiator behind the goal to diversify our attack lanes.

**Reporter:** What are your targets for the next three games?
**Coach:** Fewer unforced turnovers, +3 ground balls per game, and >50% draw controls. If we hit those, the wins will follow.

**Reporter:** Final message to fans?
**Coach:** We’re trending up — tighter details, better possessions, and we’re excited to finish close games.
